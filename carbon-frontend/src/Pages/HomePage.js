            A carbon footprint is a measure of the total greenhouse gas emissions, primarily carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚), caused by human activities.
            <br/>In the context of coal mining in India, it accounts for emissions generated during the extraction, processing, transportation, and combustion of coal.
            <br/>These emissions significantly contribute to global warming and climate change. By understanding the carbon footprint of mining operations, companies
            <br/>and individuals can identify ways to reduce environmental impact. Our carbon footprint calculator for Indian coal mines helps measure these emissions,
            <br/>providing insights that can guide sustainable practices and cleaner energy transitions.
